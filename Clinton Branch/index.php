        <h2 class="intro_title">Be a part of Morningside Community Development Association</h2>
            <p class="intro_text">To be a part of an organization that will work to provide housing that is affordable to low-income and moderate-income persons; to provide educational enrichment programs to enhance job opportunities; to encourage private and public sector to actively participate in the economic development of the community; and to reverse the growing trend of HIV / AIDS in the community.

        <h2 class="intro_title">The latest on the fight against HIV / AIDS</h2>
            <p class="intro_text">It has been reported that for the first time people being treated for AIDS has been surpassed by reported cases. However, we are a very long way from saying HIV / AIDS has been eradicated. Case in point the Morningside Community has seen a rise in HIV / AIDS amongst women between the ages of 17 - 35. It is reported by Dallas Health and County Services that African American women make up over 70% of people living with HIV in Dallas County. HIV / AIDS is the leading cause of death of African American women between the ages of 25 and 44. 60% of African Americans know someone that is living with HIV / AIDS or someone who has died with the disease. 50% have a family member that is living with or has died from the disease.
            </p>
            
        <h2 class="intro_title">People in our local neighborhood needed help. Here's what we did..</h2>
            <img src="includes/images/img9.jpg" alt="" class="featured_image"/><p class="intro_text">We provided our seniors that are home owners with fans. 
            <br>We participated with MLK Community and donated complete Thanksgiving Dinners to families that were in need. 
            <br>We also adapted an assisted and rehabilitation center and provided them with blankets, wraps, and personal items. 
            <br>We also provided support for utility bill payments.
